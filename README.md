# PRINTSMARTER - Secure Touchless Banking Transactions

## Introduction
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for touchless technologies has surged to mitigate the spread of communicable diseases. Our project focuses on enhancing the banking sector's efficiency and safety by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This solution aims to simplify banking transactions for all users, including those who are illiterate, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: For intelligent decision-making and prediction.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: To drive automation and user interaction.
- **Secure Interaction Protocols**: Ensuring the safety of transactions between devices.

## Features
- **Touchless Transactions**: Minimizing physical contact and reducing the risk of disease transmission.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible by everyone, including users with no formal education.
- **High Accuracy and Efficiency**: Leveraging technology to complete transactions quickly and with great accuracy.
- **Innovative Security Measures**: Employing advanced security protocols to protect user data and transactions.

## Security
Our project introduces a secure interaction method between devices, utilizing a custom machine learning model. This model is not only secure but also straightforward to implement, ensuring that the transactions are protected against potential threats.

## Implementation Results
The implementation of our model demonstrated its reliability and effectiveness across various scenarios. Detailed results and analysis of these implementations are discussed in the later sections of this document.

## Conclusion
Despite significant advancements in banking technology, there remain gaps that our project aims to address. By focusing on security, user accessibility, and the integration of AI and ML, we offer a comprehensive solution that enhances the banking experience for all users. Our project represents a step forward in the ongoing evolution of banking technologies, promising benefits for users and institutions alike.

## Future Work
